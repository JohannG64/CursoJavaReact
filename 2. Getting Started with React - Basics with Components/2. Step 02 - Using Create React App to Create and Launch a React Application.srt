00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,240
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,780
In the first few steps of this course, for almost an hour and half, we will be focusing on the React application.
2

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,760
You would want to understand the basic concepts of React.
3

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,560
Most importantly, how do you build components with React? In the step,
4

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,830
let's start with creating a simple React application.
5

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,600
How do you create a React application?
6

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,590
create-react-app
7

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,040
If you do a Google search for create-react-app. you'd land up on the create-react-app homepage.
8

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,680
This is a GitHub repository, and you'd see that create-react-app
9

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,950
is used to set up a modern web application by running one command.
10

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,510
Basically what it helps us to do, is to create a simple React application just by running one simple
11

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,800
command.
12

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,090
What is that command?
13

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,510
Just scroll down a little and here it is.
14

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,230
So if you execute a command which is similar to this create-react-app, it would create the basic setup of
15

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,730
a React application.
16

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,730
Actually it would create an application which is good enough to take to production, as is.  To be able
17

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,040
to use the create-react-app,
18

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,690
We would need node and npm.
19

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,050
Let us launch up our terminal command prompt.
20

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,760
If you're on Mac it's terminal.
21

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
If you are on any other operating system like windows for example you have to launch up the command
22

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,160
prompt.
23

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,960
Just type in terminal, and you'd be able to launch up the terminal window. If you're on Windows you might
24

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,410
want to launch up the command prompt in this way.
25

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,800
Press Control-Esc.
26

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,950
Launch up the start menu, type in Ã§md, click the command prompt and it will open up for you now.
27

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,830
Once your terminal or command prompt is opened, all that you need to do is type in node
28

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,030
--version.
29

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,730
So important to note there are two hyphens in here,  right? So it's node --version
30

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,310
So once you have a version which is greater than 10 that's cool.
31

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,420
You can also type in npm -version to find out which npm version you have.
32

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,850
If either node doesn't work for you, or the npm doesn't work for you, make sure that you check the installation
33

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,390
guide which we looked at earlier in the course.
34

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,120
The command we need to execute to create the React app is in npx create-react-app and
35

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,860
the name of your application.
36

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:27,390
So the way we can do that is npx create-react-app <the name of the application>,  the name of the application
37

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,550
I would want to use is todo-app.
38

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,170
But before that what we need to do we need to move to the folder where we would want to create this
39

40
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,950
particular application, right!
40

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,410
So let's cd  to the folder where you'd want to create that application.
41

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,260
I want to create it in this folder so I am doing a cd to in28minutes/git/full-stack-with
42

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:54,930
react-and-spring-boot/ frontend. And over here, I can execute the npx command -  npx create-react-app
43

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:03,310
todo-app. Once you execute this command, you'll see that this would take a little bit of time
44

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,900
because this would create the project and also build it.
45

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,510
So this project is created.
46

47
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,640
Now it's trying to build it.
47

48
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,870
It's trying to install a few dependencies. React,  React DOM and React Script, and also their transitive
48

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,700
dependencies.
49

50
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,310
So only things that React DOM needs to work. All the things that React needs to work, and all the things
50

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,830
that React Scripts need to work.
51

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,350
If you have a problem at this stage and if you are not seeing a project being built like this, or if
52

53
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,840
you get a permissions error, then one of the things you can do is you can try and launch up the command
53

54
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,990
prompt as an administrator.
54

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,620
So all here when you press control-Esc, launch up the command prompt and open up command prompt. All 
55

56
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,070
Over here, if you right click on the command prompt you ca do Run As  Administrator. If you are on Mac. or 
56

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,270
On Linux you can try Sudo.
57

58
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,760
So instead of trying npx create-react-app todo-app,  you can try doing sudo npx create-react-app
58

59
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,000
todo- app.
59

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,910
The other useful thing to do is to google for create-react-app troubleshooting.
60

61
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,330
This would take you to a github page with Facebook , to  get a broader view.
61

62
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:19,630
So once you click that you can see a few other things you can do right now. You see that the installation
62

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,220
is going on right now.
63

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,100
It might take a few minutes especially if you're running it for the first time. And after the whole thing
64

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,660
is done, you'd see that it lists the different commands that you can run.
65

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,930
The great thing is now if the entire application is set up,  so if you open up that specific folder. So
66

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,580
if I do present working directory pwd,  this is a folder where the project is created.
67

68
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,830
So if I go to frontend,  there is a todo-app folder where all the content is created.
68

69
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,980
The entire project is created in this specific folder.
69

70
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:59,650
There are a number of commands which create-react-app enables. You can do npm test to run the unit
70

71
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,210
test which are present in the project.
71

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:09,100
You can do npm run build to create a production deployable, where we write JavaScript code in modern
72

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,320
javascript applications.
73

74
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,300
We would create hundreds of JavaScript files and it not efficient in production to have hundreds of
74

75
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,650
JavaScript files.
75

76
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,910
So what npm run build does,  is it merges everything into a compressed set of JavaScript files, which you
76

77
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,770
can then use for production.
77

78
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,440
All these features are actually built in into the application which is created by using the create-react-
78

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,340
app.
79

80
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,540
The thing that you'd want to do now is to launch up the application.
80

81
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,570
Let us do that right now. The way you can launch up the application is by saying npm start.
81

82
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,080
So it's the command which is present in here.
82

83
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,660
npm start.  So when you press npm start,
83

84
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,270
there there's an error.
84

85
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,390
It says I cannot find a package.json File.
85

86
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,940
Okay cool.
86

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,630
Let me check the present working directory and they are in linux,  or they are in Windows.
87

88
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,470
You'd see that I'm still in the frontend folder. To be able to run the npm start command,
88

89
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,310
I would need to  cd into the todo-app folder.
89

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,000
So let's do a cd to the todo-app folder, and now let's go ahead and run npm start.
90

91
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,710
And this would kick off the launch of the project.
91

92
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,520
So you can see that the project starts up and launches it in the browser as well.
92

93
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,830
This might take a little while.
93

94
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:31,990
The pages still loading and you'd see that it's showing the URLs on the console.
94

95
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,460
So if you'd want to launched it in Chrome, you can take this URL and launch it in Chrome.
95

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
Most probably it would have been automatically launched up in your default browser.
96

97
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,990
What if it has not launched in your default browser, then you can take this URL and execute it preferably
97

98
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,890
in Chrome, because that's the browser we be using for the most part in this course.
98

99
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,060
Congratulations!
99

100
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,570
In the step, we created a React application. All that we needed to do was to execute a command npx
100

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,160
create-react-app and give the name of the application.
101

102
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,350
The application was created and after that, we just needed to do npm start to launch that application
102

103
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,360
up, and we were able to see the application in the browser.
103

104
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,780
Right now we don't really understand what's happening in the background.
104

105
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,530
And that's what we would be looking at in the subsequent steps. Until the next step, bye bye!
