00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,820
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,380
In the previous step, we launched up our first React app in the browser.
2

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,550
Isn't that cool!
3

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,950
Let's take a step further.
4

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,260
In this particular step let's try and make a small change to this React app, and see how to get that
5

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,600
change rendered in the browser.
6

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,470
What we do is we will use Visual Studio Code as the IDE. Let's now launch the application in Visual
7

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,370
Studio Code, during the installation guide section of this course.
8

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,550
You have already installed Visual Studio code. With the launch of Visual Studio Code,
9

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,540
This is what you would see.
10

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,610
You'd see that we have actually worked on a number of projects recently to make sure that this code
11

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,390
is perfect.
12

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,120
The other things that you see in here are help and the learned stuff.
13

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,490
I would recommend you to spend some time with the learn stuff, to familiarize yourself with the Visual
14

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,420
Studio Code IDE.
15

16
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,010
There are a lot of things that you can customize with these IDE, but now would want to open up our
16

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,800
project in Visual Studio Code.There are two ways you can do that: one is open folder.
17

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,170
So once you click open folder, you can navigate to the folder where your project is, and you can open
18

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,730
it.
19

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,620
The other option is drag and drop.
20

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,310
So I've created todo-app in this specific folder.
21

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,940
I can drag it and directly drop it in here.
22

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,390
Once you drag the folder in there,  Visual Studio Code would open up that particular project.
23

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,820
You can see the different folders from that specific project, and other files which are present in there
24

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,200
as well.
25

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,730
Now let's pick up one of these files package.json.  Let's not worry about what the content of this
26

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,600
file is, for now.
27

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,990
Now I would want to see this in full screen.
28

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,050
How can I do that? The way you can do that is by toggling the explorer bar or by using a control-B, or
29

30
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,940
a command-B.
30

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,910
This is very important because whenever you are working on a file you would want to actually work in
31

32
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,480
fullscreen mode, and that's the reason why you wanted to cover it up.
32

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,330
The first thing that we teach as part of our IDE is : Control B or command B is the shortcut to actually
33

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,240
maximize this window.
34

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,240
The other thing you can do is also to toggle the explorer back.
35

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,670
So what are you are testing in here is called the Explorer bar, where you can actually navigate through all
36

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,250
the files folders and everything related to your project.
37

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,720
There are a lot of other features which are present in Visual Studio code.
38

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,440
You can search for a file.
39

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,730
You can look at your source control, I mean if we actually put it in a Git repository or something.
40

41
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,440
You can actually check which files are committed,  which are not -  all that stuff in total control in here.
41

42
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,650
You can debug, as well as there are a number of extensions you can add on top of Visual Studio code. You
42

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,820
can check all that stuff on the left hand side bar, which is present in here. For now,
43

44
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,310
let's not worry about all of them. Let's focus on actually learning React. Now that we have the application
44

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,240
opened up in the IDE, let's make a couple of changes. I'll open up the source folder and the public folder.
45

46
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,480
The public folder has something called index.html, which is actually the page which is loaded
46

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,930
up when we type in localhost:3000 in the browser.
47

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,430
This index.html contains a title element. You can see that the title is React App in here.
48

49
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,060
Let's make a small change.
49

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,120
Let's call this Todo Application,  or even further,
50

51
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,150
You can call this My Todo Application.
51

52
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,960
You'd see that the changes immediately reflected on the browser.
52

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,450
Right.
53

54
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,010
So the title comes from index.html.
54

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,960
That's what we understood right.
55

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,360
The App.js is where all the rest of the content of the page is coming from.
56

57
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,570
So inside the source there is a file called App.js,  and this contains all the stuff you are seeing in
57

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:57,910
here.
58

59
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,910
So you can see that there is a logo which is being put and it says.
59

60
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,370
Edit src/App.js. I'll save it and I will do a reload.
60

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,380
So what I'll do is now I'll remove all this content which is present in here.
61

62
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,110
Let's remove the header which is present in the here and let's save it.
62

63
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,170
Let's see if the change reflects. Yep, the change reflects immediately. To make it easy.
63

64
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,870
I'll say My Hello
64

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,560
World, and save it.
65

66
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,160
Now you'd see that the change is reflected in the browser.
66

67
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,800
Now what?
67

68
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,740
What's the magic that is happening here, is that the change in index.html is getting reflected, App.js
68

69
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,730
is getting reflected! All that magic is happening because of the create-react-app.
69

70
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,610
When we build the application with create-react-app and we started using npm start, automatically
70

71
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,080
It would keep scanning your code for changes.
71

72
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,420
So as soon as a code change happens, it is automatically built and it is rendered to the browser.
72

73
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,410
In this step we imported the project into our IDE.
73

74
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,850
Visual Studio Code,  and we also made a couple of modifications to it, and saw that they were
74

75
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,010
immediately rendered in the browser.
75

76
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,520
In the next step we would start looking at the individual folders, and the different files which are
76

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,990
present in here.
77

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll see you in the next step. Until then, bye-bye!
