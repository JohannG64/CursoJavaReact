Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,910
In this step, we will want to help you get quickly started with the course.
2

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,620
The first thing I would want to do is to congratulate you on making a great choice.
3

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,710
Now let's get down to getting started with the course.
4

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,080
The first thing you would need to do, is to bookmark the github repository of the course.
5

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,960
You'll find a link to it in the resources section of the video you're watching right now.
6

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:32,120
You just have to hover over to the left top corner of the screen, and you should see resources, and a link
7

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,800
to the repository.
8

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,640
Just click it, launch the GitHub repository, and bookmark the URL. The repository contains links to all
9

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,430
the installation guides we use,
10

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,880
step-by-step details of the course, and also the source code.
11

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,250
Also present is the source code at various intervals of the course.
12

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,560
For example, let's pick up one of these files from here.
13

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,890
You'd see that this complete backup is present as one single file.
14

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,390
This acts as a reference if you face a problem during this course.
15

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,340
If you're having a problem with the map method, and you're unable to work out the syntax, all that you
16

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,250
need to do is to go to one of the backups and find out how it's done. You just need to search for
17

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,060
todos.map, and you'll be able to find how it should be done
18

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,160
The first sections of the course focus extensively on React.
19

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,530
The tools that you need for that section are npm and Visual Studio Code.
20

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,630
If you go to the homepage of the GitHub repository and search for installation guides, you'll see a playlist
21

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,230
which will help you to install NodeJS and Visual Studio Code.
22

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,100
This playlist contains three steps: 1) Installing NodeJS and npm
23

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,400
2) A quick introduction to npm, as well as 3) installing Visual Studio Code.
24

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,680
You can install Java, Eclipse and the embedded Maven in Eclipse,
25

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,220
when we get to the Spring Boot section of the course a little later. For now, we would recommend that
26

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,360
you pause the video in here, and install NodeJS and Visual Studio code. You can use this playlist watch
27

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,280
it and install those two tools.
28

29
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,300
If you have successfully installed the NodeJS and Visual  Studio Code, you're ready to rock the React
29

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,180
world.
30

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:22,140
If you're a Java developer looking at front-end code for the first time, the first few steps can be overwhelming.
31

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,190
You'll be using a new language.
32

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,850
You'll be using a new IDE, 
33

34
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,790
Visual Studio Code, and you'll be using a new framework React, and will be using something called
34

35
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,660
create-react-app, which is a new tool.
35

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,940
The first few steps contain a little bit of theory, to introduce you to the various parts of developing
36

37
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
modern javascript applications.
37

38
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,530
Once you get to the second section of the course, you will be spending 95 percent of the time getting
38

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,130
your hands dirty.
39

40
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,540
The recommended approach to follow the course, is to take the steps one at a time.
40

41
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,290
Do them in the order,
41

42
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,180
They are present  in the course.
42

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,660
We'll talk about the remaining sections of the course, when we get to them.
43

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,240
Let's get started with understanding the application architecture in the next step. Until then. bye bye!
